pseudo code means no syntax ,just assumption
variables are like containers that holds something

PERSON1=ramu #no space between value and =

$PERSON1

dynamic passing variables
arguments args == parameters
$1=suresh
$2=ramesh

#!/bin/bash
# ^ This is the "Shebang". It tells the computer: "Use the Bash program to run this file."

# 1. CAPTURE THE USER ID
# $(id -u) runs the Linux command 'id -u' which gives your numeric ID.
# Root is always 0. Regular users (like ubuntu) are usually 1000+.
USERID=$(id -u)

# 2. CHECK IF USER IS ROOT (The Bouncer)
# -ne means "Not Equal".
# Logic: "If your ID is NOT 0 (not Root), then stop immediately."
# NOTE: There is a syntax error in your snippet. You need a space before the closing ].
# It should be: [ $USERID -ne 0 ]
if [ $USERID -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Please run this script with root user access"
    # exit 1 means "Stop the script and signal Error (1) to the system."
    exit 1
fi

# 3. THE ACTUAL WORK
echo "Installing Nginx"
# -y means "Yes". Don't ask "Are you sure?" just do it.
dnf install nginx -y

# 4. CHECK IF IT WORKED (The Quality Control)
# $? is a special variable that holds the status of the VERY LAST command (dnf install).
# 0 = Success. Anything else (1-127) = Failure.
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "installing nginx....FAILURE"
    exit 1 # Stop here because it failed.
else
    echo "Installing Nginx...SUCCESS"
    # The script continues naturally or ends here happily.
